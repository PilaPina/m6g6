# This project is using Recoil: a React State management library. 
Recoil has two core concepts:  atoms and selectors. 

- Atoms: 
  - Think of an atom as a box that can hold some information (we call this “state”)
  - Create a box by giving it a unique name (the “cache key”) and putting some default information in it
  - Components can look inside the box, use the information, and change it
  - When information in the box changes, all components using it will know about the change
  - Similar to how useState works in React

- Selectors: 
  - Like atoms, but used for information calculated based on other information (we call this “derived data”)
  - Look inside atoms and other selectors, and do things that might take time (like fetching data from a server)
  - Different parts of the program can use selectors and will be updated when the information in the selector changes

  

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
